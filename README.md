## IA Response Review - Notification

1. There are two ways to review the response generated by Artificial Intelligence, starting with the notification.

   ![Notification_message](./_docs/images/local_forum_ai_notification_message.png)

2. Entering the notification takes us to this view, where it shows us details about the forum and the generated message.

   ![Notification_details](./_docs/images/local_forum_ai_notification_details.png)

3. In this view we can edit the message generated by the AI.

   ![Notification_details_edit](./_docs/images/local_forum_ai_notification_details_edit.png)

4. When everything is reviewed we decide whether to approve or reject the response.

## IA Response Review - List

1. The second way to review the responses generated by the list is to go to the course and access reports.
